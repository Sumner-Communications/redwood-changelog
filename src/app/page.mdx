## Email Verification, SKUs & More {{ date: '2026-02-24T00:00Z' }}

We've introduced email verification for new accounts, added SKU visibility across the platform, and made a number of improvements to mobile experience, product pages, and communication flows.

### <SparkleIcon /> New Features

- **Email verification** — New buyers and suppliers are now prompted to verify their email address. Buyers can skip for now, while supplier verification helps ensure higher-quality wholesalers.
- **Smarter category pages** — Category pages now show only the products relevant to that category for each supplier, rather than displaying all of a supplier's products. This makes browsing by category more focused and useful. This leverages the power of AI.
- **SKU visibility** — SKUs are now displayed on product pages and product cards in the storefront, making it easier for buyers to reference and reorder specific items
- **Flexible product listings** — Traffic plan suppliers can now list products without a product link. When no link is provided, buyers are prompted to send an inquiry directly. Products with links offer both an inquiry option and a direct link to the product page

### <SparkleIcon /> Improvements

- **Seamless buyer-supplier communication** — Order confirmation emails now let buyers and suppliers reply directly to each other, so conversations continue without extra steps
- **Better date formatting** — Billing emails now display dates in standard US format for clarity
- **Google Sign-In** — Cancelling the Google sign-in flow is now handled gracefully — no need to refresh the page. Additionally, if you try to sign in with email and password but your account is linked to Google, you'll now see a helpful prompt guiding you to use Google Sign-In instead
- **Search bar spacing** — Improved spacing and layout in the search bar for a cleaner look
- **Enhanced product validation** — Products and images are now continuously verified, so broken links and missing images are automatically detected and removed from search results
- **Smarter product categorization** — Products are now automatically assigned to the right categories using AI, so they appear in the most relevant places across the platform
- **Search bar results** — The search dropdown now has a fixed height with a scrollbar, making it easier to see and browse through all suggested results

### <SparkleIcon /> Bug Fixes
